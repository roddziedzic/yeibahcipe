                            <p> Go ahead and make me an offer on any of these items. I’ve included shipping in my prices. Thanks! If you want pictures I can send some to you just ask. Thank you! Wii remote charging system,  SOLD - it’s a 4 controller energizer induction charging station. I got it with a bundle of games I got from an estate sale. It’s in good condition. I have no idea if it works. Batteries not included. SOLD Rock band drum set, pedal, and game for Xbox 360 -  SOLD The cords are in great condition. Has anyone had any luck getting the Wii keyboard to work on phase shift? I'm sure I can figure something out, but if people know already 
With the discontinuation of the Wii Shop Channel I thought the Rock Band 3 store might still be accessible, but now it just crashes my Wii when I try to go in. Is anyone else having this issue, and could it be fixed. I have a dolphin bar if that changes anything. When I tried using WiitarThing it said "incompatible Infrareds detected". I’ve come across an older rock band guitar for the Wii. It’s the fender Stratocaster style that doesn’t use the Wii remote, and I was wondering if anybody knows how to or if it’s possible to connect it to the PC? Have you tried syncing it to Bluetooth the way you would with the Wii remote, but it seems like it uses a different method. I thank maybe these required a dongle to even connect to the Wii, but I’m not sure if connecting that same dongle to the PC would allow henlo Have Mega Man (NES) Animal Crossing DS N64 (no memory pak) Want Mario Kart Wii Rock Band Instruments (Wii) Paypal. 
I bought this dongle for my drum kit for rock band on wii. I tryed it and it never worked. I went inside and saw a sticker that said "RoHs". I removed it and it said this under it "PS3 Wireless Drum _Dongle Rev 00" and was confused as to why. It was in a white case and when buying it said that it was for Wii. Can someone A weird number, but I have .06 in PayPal to spend on this game. Also interested in the keyboard but could spend Old game, I know, but I haven't been able to find anything out about this by searching online or in this subreddit, and I was wondering if anyone could help. Songs stored on my SD card don't always load the album art on the song selection screen. The song previews play just fine (though some can be a bit quiet), but I'd say maybe half of the album covers never load. Re-downloading the song doesn't seem to fix the issue. I tried using a newer, faster card, but same thing occurs. Sorry if this has been asked a lot. I've been digging everywhere trying to find the answer to this question, but it's never been clear if people are talking about trying to play these games with real Wii instruments, real instruments built for another console, or some emulated version of the instruments. So, if I go buy some real Wii Rock Band/Guitar Hero drums, guitars, and mics, will I be able to play those games using the real controllers in Dolphin? Also, how do these controllers connect. I suddenly have the urge to play Rock Band again after many years and I still have the guitars, drums, keyboard, and mic. Problem is, I have no idea where my dongles for them are (the things that you'd plug into the Wii itself). Is there a way to use the controllers without the actual dongles? Could you do it through USB Passthrough using the Dolphin emulator? Or should I just cough up the  or so to get new ones? edit: I own Rock Bands 1, 2, 3, and Beatles and those This might be a biased thread to post this on, but I was hoping you guys might know prices better than me. I have a chance of getting a  used bundle for the Wii including: Rock Band 2, Beatles, Country 1x Drum Set 2x Guitars 
I recently bought a preowned Rock Band 3 P Bass for the wii that didn't come with the dongle, i know rock band 3 guitars are interchangable with rb3 dongles but does anyone know if the P Bass requires its own unique dongle and if so where I'm looking for, basically, anyone who wants to play Rock band 2 with me on the Wii. I say this because I can't find anyone on the Wii Rock band 2 servers. I play expert Guitar and Bass, and can do singing sometimes. All difficulty levels are welcome. Just wondering whether or not it's possible to connect the a Wii rock bank controller to the wii U. The sync doesn't seem to be working but I'm not sure if its even possible. Thanks. 
This is the drum set that goes with the Wii Rock Band. Don't have the game or the other accessories. If interested, porch pick up. Live in southern New Rochelle, right at the Pelham border. from Craigslist ( via IFTTT (http://ift.tt/1gYSBZM). We are going to do a small, or possibly not small if people like it, Wii Rock Band party a block from the Convention Center. We are coming in from out of town and would love to find someone (the more the merrier) who would enjoy helping us throw something fun and laid back. Someone with Rock Band gear (e.g. Guitars, Mics, Drum Set, Wii) would be amazing (and cheaper than buying or shipping our gear in). We are doing this to get a little attention for a tiny mobile app startup that my friend. I'm pretty sure I'm hitting the notes because I've been doing very well while playing RB2, but for some reason not all of the notes are registering for RB1. The same thing might be happening for my two track packs as well, but I can't quite remember. Has anyone else experienced this? Is RB2 easier than 1? Maybe there's more leeway when hitting the notes and having them still count? But it's only been for the yellow pad so that doesn't really make sense :/ I don't want to miss out on the songs. </p>
